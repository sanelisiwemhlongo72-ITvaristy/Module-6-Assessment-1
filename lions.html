                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p> Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides. Prides are family
         units that may include up to three males,
         a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and 
         female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually leave and 
         establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.</p>
     <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling
          down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes 
          that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's
           mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones. Young lions have light spotting on their coats
          that disappears as they grow. </p>
   <p>Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest. 
       Except for a small population of the Indian lion subspecies that remains in the Gir Forest of
        northwest India, lions now live only in Africa, from the Sahara's southern fringe to northern
         South Africa. They are absent from equatorial areas
        dominated by moist tropical forest. </p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions in the Nouthern Frontiers.</p>
