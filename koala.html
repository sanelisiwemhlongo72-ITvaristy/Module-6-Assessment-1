                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p> The koala is an iconic Australian animal. Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing
         animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring. Though
          koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep. They have two 
          opposing thumbs on their hands, and both their feet and hands have rough pads and claws
           to grab onto branches. They have two toes, fused 
        together, on their feet, which they use to comb their fur.</p>
     <p>Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. 
         When not sleeping, they’re usually eating. They rely on the eucalyptus tree for 
         both habitat and food. Koalas can eat more than a poundof eucalyptus leaves a day. 
         Eucalyptus is toxic, so the koala’s digestive system has to work hard to digest it,
          breaking down the toxins and extracting limited nutrients. </p>
   <p>Koala numbers plummeted in the late 19th and early 20th century from hunting for their fur.
        Now they face serious threats from habitat loss. Land clearing, logging, and
         bushfires—especially the devastating 2019-2020 season—have destroyed much of the 
         forest they live in. Koalas need a lot of space—about a hundred trees per animal—a
        pressing problem as Australia's woodlands continue to shrink.  </p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
