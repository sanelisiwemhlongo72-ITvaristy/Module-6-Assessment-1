                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p> Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks.
         A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet . 
         These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances
         and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>
     <p>Giraffe Behavior. Giraffes are social animals. Female giraffes associate in groups called herds,
          occasionally including a few younger males.
          Mature males live in "bachelor" herds and fight for dominance using their necks.
          older males are usually solitary. 
         Giraffes feed and drink during the morning and evening. </p>
