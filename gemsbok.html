                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>Gemsbok are light brownish-gre to tan in colour,with light patches towards of the rump. Their tails are
         long and black in colour. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower. edge of the neck, 
         through  the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear
          leg.  They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch
           on the front of both the front legs , and both genders have long, straight horns
        </p>
     <p>Gemsbok live in herds of about 10-40 animals, which consist of a dominant male,
          a few nondominant males, and females. They are mainly desert-dwelling and 
          do not depend on drinking water to supply their physiological needs.
          They can reach running speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph).</p>
   <p>Gemsbok are widely hunted for their spectacular horns that average 85 cm (33 in) in length. 
       From a distance, the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, 
       and many hunters mistake females for males each year. In males, these horns are perfectly 
       straight, extending from the base of the skull to a slight outward and rearward angle. Females have 
       longer, thinner horns with a slight outward and rearward 
       curve in addition to their angle. </p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok, right next to the Panda Canyon.</p>
