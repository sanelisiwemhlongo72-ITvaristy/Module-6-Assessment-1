                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Brains before beauty: Warthogs may not be the most beautiful or graceful 
        creatures in the Animal Kingdom. But they are remarkable for their strength, 
        intelligence, and flexibility! Unlike many of their African counterparts, they are not
         endangered. This is because they are so skilled at adapting to new threats. For example,
          most warthogs like to forage during the light of the morning and early evening. But if they 
          live in an area where people hunt them, they switch to 
        foraging at night. It's not easy to catch them. </p>
     <p>Home, sweet aardvark hole: Warthogs live in Africa's southern Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia,
          in savanna woodland and grasslandsand they are not picky about their homes. Instead of digging 
          their own burrows, they find abandoned aardvark holes or natural burrows for homes. This is where
           they raise their young, sleep, and hide from predators. They usually back into the burrow, so they 
           can use their 
         sharp tusks to scare off any animal that bothers them. </p>
   <p>When one of the boars gives up, the other boar gets to mate with the sows.
        Then the boars go back to their solitary life until the next mating season. 
        Although the boars are mature by 20 months, they usually dont get to mate until 
        theyre about 4 years old. At that point, theyre strong 
        experienced enough to win one of the mating battles. </p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthog near the insect house.</p>
